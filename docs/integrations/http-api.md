# Http API
You can use the _API Gateway_ service to expose HTTP endpoints from the platform to external systems.

It already offers endpoints for managing agents and sending signals out-of-the-box. You can of course extend it with additional
endpoints if the need arises.

You can find the full HTTP API specification [here](/api).

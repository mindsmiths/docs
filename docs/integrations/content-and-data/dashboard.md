# Dashboard

Here you write a short description for this service/data source.

## When to use integration with Dashboard?

Give some examples when someone can benefit from integrating with the Dashboard.

## Core features

* one possible feature
* another possible feature
* etc.

## Setup

If I have a "clean" project and I start with integrating with the Dashboard, what are the steps I need to take?

### Installation

Is there something I need to install? If yes, how?

### Environment variables

Are there any environment variables I need to set? If yes, which ones and where to find them?
If no, feel free to delete this section.

## How to use the Dashboard?

Start with explaining the basic usage of the Dashboard. If you have a lot of content, you can split it into multiple sections.
You can see that the initial breakdown of the content is already here, but you can add more or change anything you
prefer if you think it will make more sense.

# Web

Mindsmiths Platform supports dynamically generated web pages.
You can use these pages to display content to your users, or to collect data from them.

The service for this is called **Armory**.

There are a couple important concepts to grasp for using Armory. We‚Äôll look at them in turn.

## Armory concepts

Let‚Äôs start from the basics: there are three different Armory signals that are caught by the Rule engine:
* **UserConnected**: emitted each time a user connects to Armory (opens the link)
* **UserDisconnected**: emitted when the user disconnects from Armory (closes the link)
* **Submit**: emitted when the user presses something on the screen (e.g. a button)

The signals are fairly straightforward. We should mention that e.g. refreshing the site emits the UserDisconnectedEvent and then the UserConnectedEvent again.

To connect to Armory, the user needs a unique`connectionId`. This id is part of that user‚Äôs URL, and will be randomly generated if not set in advance. 

`UNDER CONSTRUCTION`
## Armory templates and components 

As mentioned, Armory already comes with a number of predefined templates and components for building screens. Once you get a hang of how they work, you are welcome to add more custom implementations.

The `GenericTemplate` is quite packed, but it can be much simpler than that - for example, we also provide a `TitleTemplate` which literally only contains a `Title` component.

The components are the building blocks of screens, and there are several of them predefined in the service, all implementing the `BaseComponent` interface:
* ActionGroup (groups together buttons into a list of options out of which only one can be selected)
* BackButton
* CloudSelect (allows user to select multiple elements from a list)
* Description
* Image
* Input (roughly corresponds to HTML input element, with the data type specified by setting `type`)
* SubmitButton (basic button which triggers a `SubmitEvent`)
* TextArea
* Title

Each component is referenced through its `componentId`. We‚Äôll use this id later on for getting the data the user provided on a screen off the `SubmitEvent`.

## Chaining Armory screens

You can link together sequences of multiple Armory screens by specifying the transitions between them. 
You just define the name of the screen the action component takes the user to. 
For example, in the code below, the ‚ÄúCool, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù button at the bottom of the welcome screen leads to the screen on 
which we ask the user for their name:

```java title="rule_engine/src/main/java/agents/Felix.java"
package agents;

import com.mindsmiths.ruleEngine.model.Agent;
import lombok.*;

import com.mindsmiths.armory.ArmoryAPI;
import com.mindsmiths.armory.Screen;
import com.mindsmiths.armory.component.*;

import com.mindsmiths.ruleEngine.util.Log;

@Data
@ToString(callSuper = true)
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Felix extends Agent {

    String name;
    
    public void showWelcomeScreens() {
        ArmoryAPI.show(
                getConnection("armory"),
                new Screen("welcome")
                        .add(new Title("Hello! I‚Äôm Felix and I‚Äôm here to help you get as hot as hell! Ready?"))
                        .add(new Image("public/JogaPuppy.png", false))
                        .add(new SubmitButton("welcomeStarted", "Cool, let's go!", "askForName")),
                new Screen("askForName")
                        .add(new Header("logo.png", false))
                        .add(new Title("Alright! First, tell me your name?"))
                        .add(new Input("name", "Type your name here", "text"))
                        .add(new SubmitButton("nameSubmited", "Done, next!"))
        );
    }
}
```

After the user provides the name, the submit button has `"nameSubmited"` as a value, which doesn‚Äôt lead to another screen, but you can still catch it in a rule and have the system react to it. 
You can remove the rule showing the demo screen and add the following:

```java title="rule_engine/src/main/resources/rules/felix/Felix.drl"
package rules.felix;

import agents.Felix
import com.mindsmiths.ruleEngine.model.Heartbeat
import com.mindsmiths.armory.event.UserConnected
import com.mindsmiths.armory.event.Submit
import com.mindsmiths.ruleEngine.util.Log

rule "Welcome new user"
   when
       signal: UserConnected() from entry-point "signals"
       agent: Felix()
   then
       agent.showWelcomeScreens();
       delete(signal);
end
```
As you can see, there is no need to write out a separate rule for the transition between the `welcome` screen and the `askForName`
screen - this will already happen because it is specified in agent‚Äôs `showWelcomeScreens()`.

Of course, you don‚Äôt always want to use predefined sequences of screens (although note that you can just as easily 
implement slightly more complex condition-based branching in logic, as long as certain actions always lead to the same outcomes). 
Sometimes you want more flexibility in allowing the system to determine which screen to show to the user depending on the 
state the user is in.

When the screen to show is determined based on other circumstances and not the fact if/which submit action the user made, you can capture this behavior through a rule.
With Armory, you can easily define multiple screen chains for different stages of the process. This can be beneficial if you want to store some data separately.
For example, in the welcome screens we asked the user for a name, and we want to store it after the procedure is completed, 
so we can use it in other screens to add a bit of personalization to the user experience. We will do this inside the `Start user onboarding` rule. 

We'll add a line to start the onboarding procedure once we have the user's name, and then add a new rule to store the data at the end of welcome flow.

How to store data? Well, the data the user inputs during the screen sequence are transferred as values of GET parameters with the corresponding `componentId` as key.
We can store the user's answers at the end of the procedure. For example, here we only asked for the name, which the user set through an input area. 
We can fetch it off the `Submit()` using `buttonId == "nameSubmitted"` because the `"nameSubmitted"` is the ID of the submit button that we will use as a trigger to take us to the next screen.


```java title="rule_engine/src/main/resources/rules/mindy/Mindy.drl"
...

rule "Start user onboarding"
    when
        signal: Submit(buttonId == "nameSubmited") from entry-point "signals"
        agent: Felix()
    then
        modify(agent){
            setName(signal.getParamAsString("name"))
            };
        agent.showOnboardingScreens();
        delete(signal);
end
```

With the implementation in agent‚Äôs java class:
```java title="rule_engine/src/main/java/agents/Felix.java"
...
@Data
@ToString(callSuper = true)
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Felix extends Agent {
    String name;
    Integer weight;
    Integer height;

    public void showOnboardingScreens() {
            ArmoryAPI.show(
                    getConnection("armory"),
                    new Screen("startOnboarding")
                            .add(new Title(String.format("Nice to meet you %s! Now let's make a workout plan just for you!\nReady? üí™", name)))
                            .add(new Image("public/GymPuppy.png", false))
                            .add(new SubmitButton("onboardingStarted", "Let's go!", "askForWeight")),
                    new Screen("askForWeight")
                            .add(new Header("logo.png", true))
                            .add(new Title("How much do you weigh in kilograms?"))
                            .add(new Input("weight", "Type your weight here", "number"))
                            .add(new SubmitButton("weightSubmited", "Next!", "askForHeight")),
                    new Screen("askForHeight")
                            .add(new Header("logo.png", true))
                            .add(new Title("How tall are you in cm?"))
                            .add(new Input("height", "Type your height here", "number"))
                            .add(new SubmitButton("heightSubmited", "Next!"))
        );
    }
}
```

# Getting started

:::note
This page is an overview of the Mindsmiths Platform documentation and related resources.
:::

**Mindsmiths Platform** is a platform for creating AI-first solutions.
It is a set of tools and services that allow you to create and deploy AI-powered agents.


### Try it out

Mindsmiths Platform is cloud-based and can be used from any browser. You can try it out for free
by contacting us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/mindsmiths) *#dev* channel.

The easiest way to get started is to go through our [tutorials](/docs/tutorials/getting-started).
They will guide you through the process of creating your first AI-powered agents, integrating with
state-of-the-art machine learning models, and connecting to the outside world.

### Quickstart

If you've already got your hands on the Web IDE and want to try the Platform out before starting with the tutorials, we've got you covered.
Here's a Quickstart guide to help you demonstrate the Platform's powers in less than 5 minutes.

# Deployment to lite production

If you want to make your system live for longer periods of time, you need to deploy it to production.

We provide two tiers of production:
- Lite production
- Standard production

Lite production is intended for free users to continue running their system in the background. It doesn't provide all the features of standard production, and it's not intended for use with real users.

With the Mindsmiths Platform, you can deploy the system to lite production in just a couple of steps.

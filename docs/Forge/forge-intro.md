# What is the Mindsmiths Platform?

Welcome! Mindsmiths Platform is a platform for **creating, evolving and running autonomous agents**. 

You can create a variety of autonomous agents for handling complex contexts and interactions. 

The main strong points of Forge are its **flexibility, extendability and ease of integration**. It gives you full freedom for crafting intelligent human-machine interactions, while saving you the technical overhead of setting up the infrastructure for building autonomous support systems.
Forge allows you to quickly devise functional prototypes, and gradually evolve more complex systems. With Forge, you can easily make use of your existing data and integrate different machine learning components. 

So let’s see Forge in action! In this simple demo, we’ll create a digital being that will be able to converse with you in a human-like way.

It sounds difficult, but it will take us just a couple of hours to do this. Let’s start! :)

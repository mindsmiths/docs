# The philosophy of Mindsmiths Platform

There are two key principles of development promoted with Forge: **user-centricity and evolution**.


**Evolution** in this sense refers to the capacity for fundamentally agile development: you don’t need heaps of data to start developing smart solutions, and you don’t need a perfectly thought-through product to unleash your agents into the world.
Forge is specifically designed to support _“dataless AI”_ in building expert knowledge, as well as utilization of pre-trained models to speed up prototyping and bridge the time you need to collect the data when already in production. You can always improve and move on to more advanced implementations as your product lives on.


When it comes to **user-centricity**, optimizing for each individual user sits at the very core of the multi-agent systems.
It gives your agents the capacity to have a personalized approach for every user, tuned to their history, specific situation and preferences, as opposed to predefined scripted behaviors.
All learning and customization of the process can be done specifically for that individual user.
Running agents in a continuous simulation using Forge also means your users are constantly under their agent’s care: the situation is constantly evaluated and monitored, enabling your agents to autonomously take proactive actions to improve the users’ experience.

At [Mindsmiths](https://www.mindsmiths.com/), we believe in the world where the best service and top-quality knowledge are accessible to everyone. By giving you Forge, we want to help you create smart and caring support systems and bring value to the world.

# Writing rules
We use the [Drools framework](https://www.drools.org/) for defining and evaluating rules.

- All rule files (ending in `.drl` extension) follow the same basic layout:
```java title="rules/agent/Example.drl"
package <path.to.current.directory>;

import ...

rule "Rule name"
    when
        // these conditions are met
    then
        // execute these actions
end
```

The rule name gives a short description of what a rule does (e.g. "Send notification to user"). The rules can be specified in any order and can be distributed in any number of files 
The `when` part of the rule is implemented purely in Drools, while the `then` part is written in Java, except for a couple Drools functions we will introduce later on (`insert`, `modify`, `delete`).

## Advantages of rule engines: simplification, flexibility, readability
TODO: find a better title
- The structure of rule engines enables you to break down highly complex scenarios into sets of very simple conditions and spares you the trouble of foreseeing all specific circumstances under which certain events might occur.
- The rules themselves are written using declarative programming. This gives you much more freedom in how you structure the logic, because the rules that fire in evaluations are determined by the data.
- The declarative programming paradigm allows you to express a piece of logic without explicitly specifying the flow of execution: the order of execution governed _only_ by the conditions the rules declare.
- Each rule should be as simple as possible: they should be independent of each other, highly separable and only contain the minimal information necessary. 
- This makes rules more easily maintainable and the system more easily extendable.
- Moreover, together with the fact that rules are written in a sort of a "meta-language", this makes rules easy to read for people of different backgrounds.

## Rule mechanics
- The reasoning in the rule engine goes on via what we call **rule evaluation**.
- The conditions that get evaluated in the `when` part of the rule basically function as a constraint or filter: we check if the current data meet some defined criteria. There is an implicit `AND` operator between the lines with different conditions, so the `when` part basically implements a query.
- When such a situation is identified, some action in the `then` part is scheduled to be executed. Whether that will actually happen also depends on some other factors (see Rule chaining below).
- Since the rule conditions work as a filter, everything used in `then` part should be referenced and assigned to a variable beforehand in the `when` part to make sure it exists.
- Variable assignment is done using a colon: the expression `Agent(agentId: id)` assigns the value of the Agent's `id` field to variable name `agentId`, and can as such be used later on in the `then` part of the rule.
- Another way to access the agent's id would be to reference the agent instead `agent: Agent()` and then use the Java getter method in the `then` part: `agent.getId()`.
- Let's look at an example to make these points slightly clearer:
```java title="rules/agent/Agent.drl"
package rules.agent;

rule "Register active customers"
    when
        agent: CustomerAgent(agentId: id, active != true)
        OngoingPurchaseProcess(customerId == agentId)
    then
        modify(agent) {setActive(true)};
end
```
- As you can probably see for yourself, this rule registers if a customer is currently in the process of purchasing something. We create a reference to the customer's agent to be able to modify the value of one of its fields in the `then` part, and we assign its id to a variable to fetch the `OngoingPurchaseProcess()` for that customer in specific. (TODO remove this part? and also think of a better example)
- The rule reads as follows: when there is a `CustomerAgent()` who is currently not flagged as `active` but there is an `OngoingPurchaseProcess()` object whose `customerId` matches the agent's, set the agent's `active` flag to `true`.
- Apart from turning your attention to how the filtering syntax looks like in the Drools syntax, a very important thing to note here is that the rule engine has no way of knowing if some rule has already fired or not: that's why you need a "stopping mechanism" - a way of making sure the conditions of a rule will at some point no longer be met to prevent infinite loops.
- It sounds like an inconvenience, but the engine being agnostic of the actions that led up to the current state is actually in many situations a desireable feature (see Rule chaining TODO).
- Among other things, this means that the control over rules firing is neither determined by the order of the rules nor by the order of the incoming data, but by the conditions the rules declare. 
- Therefore, you can write any number of rules in whichever order you want and distributed over any number of files - just make sure they are all in the correct location (TODO see Creating agents).


- In short, during an evaluation cycle, a rule can recognize that a specific situation has occurred (`when`) and perform some action (`then` - usually triggering some series of procedures or modifying the knowledge base).
- The Drools rule engine uses the highly optimized Phreak algorithm (based on the Rete algorithm) in rule evaluation, and the sequence flow is determined by the engine at runtime.
- These evaluation cycles can happen periodically at a specific rate (see Heartbeat TODO: link). Alternatively they can be triggered by certain signals or updates to the knowledge base.

## Rule reasoning: Signals and facts
- While **signals** are not persisted in memory between evaluation cycles, the **knowledge base** contains "facts" persisted in memory on which we do the reasoning. 
- Rules are evaluated per agent (see Creating agents TODO: link), and by default, the only entity present in the knowledge base at the very beginning is the agent itself.
- You update the knowledge base using special reserved Drools keywords `insert`, `modify` and `delete`.
- For instance, although signals are by default discarded once they are processed, you can store them permanently by using `insert` and use it in another rule as a fact: (TODO: think of better examples)
```java title="rules/agent/Agent.drl"
rule "Store user orders"
    when
        order : Order() from entry-point "signals"
        agent: CustomerAgent()
    then
        insert(order);
end

rule "Update active order"
    when
        agent: CustomerAgent()
        order: Order(active == true, processed != true)
    then
        modify(order) {setProcessed(false)};
end
```
- Notice that signals are received by the Rule Engine from specific entry points (the default one is "signals"), while there is no entry point for retrieving facts stored in the knowledge base.
- You can also build custom objects on the fly in the `then` part, e.g. `insert(new Purchase(itemList));`.
- Once the object is in the knowledge base, you can of course modify (see example above) or delete it. Note that even though signals are not persisted after the triggered evaluation cycle is complete, we still recommend deleting them in the `then` part of the rule in which you process it once you no longer need them (see Rule chaining below).
- You can think of the `modify` function as the equivalent of Java setter method. However, if you just use a regular setter, your changes won't be persisted outside the current evaluation cycle.
- Another big group of conditions are [time-based conditions](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_decision_manager/7.4/html/decision_engine_in_red_hat_decision_manager/cep-con_decision-engine). They closely relate to proactivity and the Heartbeat service (TODO: link). Let's look at an example:
```java title="rules/agent/Agent.drl"
rule "Re-engage inactive"
    when
        Heartbeat(ts: timestamp) from entry-point "signals"
        agent: CustomerAgent(lastActivity before[60d] ts, reengageAttempted != true)
    then
        agent.sendMessage("Hey! It's been a while ðŸ˜Š Is there anything I can help you with?");
        modify(agent) {setReengageAttempted(true)};
end
```
- What's happening here is very simple: we read off the timestamp from the latest Heartbeat signal that was sent for that agent and compare to the customer's last recorded activity. If more than 60 days have passed between those two timestamps, we send the user a message to try to engage them.
- We also set the `reengageAttempted` flag to true to prevent the rule from re-firing until the user responds and potentially sets a new value for the `lastActivity` timestamp.

## Chaining rules
TODO: find some example
- It's difficult to see the advantages of rule engines looking just at single simple rules: their true power is most obvious interactions of the rules when handling more complex behaviours.
- As already mentioned, the order of execution of rules is not pre-imposed and whenever the facts in the knowledge base change, rules are re-evaluated.
- Therefore, although rules are in principle independent of each other, they can indirectly depend on each other in terms of the outcome of one rule bringing about triggering of another. For example, it's relatively frequent that a rule modifies a fact in memory, and another rule detects when the fact has that specific value. This is called **rule chaining**.
- Thinking of the road-crossing situation (TODO: link), rule chaining comes in handy for breaking down a complex reasoning process into a series of circumstances that need to be evaluated and whose outcomes accumulate to ultimately make the final decision whether to cross a simple one.
- It's generally advisable to try and break down the reasoning in as many steps as possible and have the sum of their outputs caught by another rule.
- Moreover, multiple rules could fire at once given some situation in the data. In this case, priority is determined using the **salience** parameter.
- The mechanism is very simple: rules with higher salience have priority over the ones with lower salience, so you can think of it as a way of imposing order of execution on rules triggered by similar conditions.
- Should the conditions for the other rules still be met afterwards, the other rule can still subsequently execute. 
- The default salience of a rule is 0, and you can also set it to a negative value. This is useful for writing "catch-all" rules, e.g. ones making sure no message from the user goes unprocessed should it trigger no other rules.

## Best practices
- The writing of rules can be slightly confusing before you get used to it, so we'll quickly summarize some good practices for rule writing.
- To improve flexibility, extendability and maintainability of the rule engine, the rules should be as simple as possible and only contain the minimal information necessary. This will also help you with rule atomicity and independence, which are desirable features.
- Use rule chaining and transparent variable naming to improve rule readability and back-tracking in how a decision was reached. Ideally, your rules should be perfectly readable to non-developers as well. Same goes for rule names: write as clearly as possible what the rule does even if it makes the rule name slightly lengthy.
- Avoid writing rules that say "condition1 or condition2 or condition3": it's better to break these down into separate rules with the same `then` part, or that have an outcome which triggers another rule that executes the desired action.
- Avoid having any if-else logic in the rules: it's more efficient to break these cases down into separate rules.
- We already mentioned that signals are not persisted between evaluation cycles, but it's good practice to still delete them once you are done processing them to avoid any unwanted behaviours as your system grows.

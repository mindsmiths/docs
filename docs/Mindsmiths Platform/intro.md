# What is the Mindsmiths Platform?

Mindsmiths Platform is a development framework for creating, evolving, and running swarms of simple digital creatures 
(autonomous agents). These agents integrate into the real world, interact with it, and learn from it.

Developers use this framework to tackle complex challenges by breaking them into tiny parts and then addressing them 
through the collaboration of autonomous agents.

Even for developers unfamiliar with the multi-agent approach to solving problems, it doesnâ€™t take much time to learn 
concepts, methodology, and the tool. Once theyâ€™re fluent, the framework rewards them with the ability to bring 
human-machine collaboration to levels not achievable with traditional programming.

To help you start, weâ€™ll explain key concepts and walk you through your first projects.

# What is the Mindsmiths Platform?

Mindsmiths Platform is a development framework for creating, evolving, and running digital creatures 
(autonomous agents). These agents integrate into the real world, interact with it, and learn from it.

You can use this framework to tackle complex challenges by breaking them into smaller chunks and addressing them 
through the collaboration of simple autonomous agents.

Even if you're not familiar with the multi-agent approach to solving problems, it doesnâ€™t take much time to learn 
the concepts, methodology, and the tool. Once you get a hang of it, the framework gives you the power to bring human-machine collaboration to levels not achievable with traditional programming.

To help you start, weâ€™ll explain key concepts and walk you through your first projects. 

Letâ€™s do it! ðŸ˜Š

# Intro

Welcome to the BMI Check Tutorial!

Here you will learn how to use more advanced features of the platform. Together, we'll develop more complex systems working with multiple agents.
You will also see how you can train new machine learning systems from scratch when you don’t have any initial data. 

Before we start, there's one more thing worth mentioning. Our key principle when creating and using agents is to realize these three core characteristics:
- I have the expertise (and that's why my advice is relevant)
- I know you (and that's why I can take care of your specific needs)
- I care about you (and that's why I'm proactively reaching out to you)

This combination brings every agent to another level and makes them emotionally intelligent. 

Now, we’re implementing a health assistant for identifying potential obesity issues in children. This is a real-life problem that is fairly well-defined, but not entirely straightforward.
At first, it requires expert knowledge from a human expert. As patients flood our doctor with requests, it will be our goal to relieve the doctor’s workload. 
A machine learning model will be fit based on the doctor's responses in the background, and once it can replicate the doctor’s decisions with sufficient confidence, 
it will take over larger and larger parts of the doctor's workload.


This is a slightly more complex use case compared to the first tutorial, but we’ll get through it together step by step,
while implementing all three agent's core characteristics.

# Intro

Welcome to the BMI Check Tutorial!

Here you will learn how to use more advanced features of the platform. Together, we'll develop more complex systems working with multiple agents.
You will also see how you can train new machine learning systems from scratch when you don’t have any initial data. 

We’re implementing a health assistant for identifying potential obesity issues in children. This is a real-life problem that is fairly well-defined, but not entirely straightforward.
At first it requires expert knowledge from a human expert. As patients flood our doctor with requests, it will be our goal to relieve the doctor’s workload. A machine learning model will be fit based on the doctor's responses in the background, and once it can replicate the doctor’s decisions with sufficient confidence, it will take over larger and larger parts of the doctor's workload.


This is a slightly more complex use case compared to the first tutorial, but we’ll get through it together step by step.

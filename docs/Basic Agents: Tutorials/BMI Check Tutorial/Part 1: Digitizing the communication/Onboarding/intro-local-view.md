# Doctor and Patient Agent: Local view

We already mentioned that each agent cares only for the needs of the user it is assigned to, 
instead of being concerned with searching for optimal solutions at system level.users69

Looking at the principles behind the implementation, there is nothing especially new you will learn from the process of onboarding patients compared to the communication agent 
you implemented in the Nola Brzina Tutorial.


So instead of typing out the code yourself, we want to draw your attention to some principles of developing smart and emotionally intelligent agents.
A key moment is shifting the focus to the users themselves: what would a patient want and need from their agent in order to feel comfortable and cared for? 

We argue that there are three key components the users look for and appreciate in this kind of digital relationships:
- personalized approach
- proactive care
- expert knowledge

We'll demonstrate these characteristics in the way we implement the agent's communication to the patients.

# Automatization dream come true

In the first section we started off with just a slight improvement of a fully physical experience in the real world by transferring it to the digital world. However, this was still a fully manual setup and we didn’t use any of the digitization perks.

Ideally, we want to automate as much of this process as possible. For example, we can add a smart machine learning model to take over all the straightforward decisions from the doctor, and only let him/her handle the edge cases.
We face two problems with that approach: we don’t have the data to train the model, and we need to choose the appropriate machine learning (ML) algorithm for this issue.


The first issue we tackle by taking the evolutionary approach to product development: we start off from putting all the workload on the doctor, and having the model sort of learning to replicate the doctor’s reasoning until its sample data size is large enough to be trained properly and make valid predictions.

As for the second problem, we have good news: you don’t need to be an expert on machine learning to get started with it. You will simply install our model trainer service that uses Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to kick-start your journey in the world of ML.

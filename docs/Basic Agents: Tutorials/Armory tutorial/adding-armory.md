# Adding Armory to your project

You can add Armory to your project in a few easy steps that follows:
1. First move - installing Armory with ```pip install armory~=4.0.0a0```
2. Next thing you should do is integrate Armory as a service into your project by typing ``` armory-admin setup```. 

By doing so, you will be prompted to set some things:
   * Agent handling signals coming from Armory
   * Armory site URL, which you will use as a generated link to access Armory later on

This process will look something like this:

```console
root:/app$ armory-admin setup
What agent will handle signals? Nola
URL of your IDE (leave empty if running locally): 
http://8000.workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io
Service successfully integrated into the project.
```

Armory will now run on:
```http://8000.workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io```

3. Check that your ```Runner.java``` reads configuration from ```signals.yaml```. It should look something like this:

```java title="src/main/java/Runner.java"
public class Runner extends RuleEngineService {
    @Override
    public void initialize() {
        configureSignals(getClass().getResourceAsStream("config/signals.yaml"));
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

If not, add ```configureSignals(getClass().getResourceAsStream("config/signals.yaml"));``` in ```initialize()```.

 
4. Final step, run ```forge init```. 

Thatâ€™s it! You can now use Armory in your project, let's find out how we can actually use it to make an awesome onboarding flow.

# Adding Armory to your project

You can add Armory to your project in a few easy steps that follows:
1. First move - installing Armory with ```pip install armory~=4.0.0a0```
2. Next thing you should do is integrate Armory as a service into your project by typing ``` armory-admin setup```. 

By doing so, you will be prompted to set some things:
   * Agent handling signals coming from Armory
   * Armory site URL, which you will use as a generated link to access Armory later on

Here we want Mindy to handle all Armory signals. For Armory site URL you'll use your environment URL, so instead of 
`http://workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io`, you should enter your web IDE link.

This process will look something like this:

```console
root:/app$ armory-admin setup
What agent will handle signals? Mindy
URL of your IDE (leave empty if running locally): 
http://workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io
Service successfully integrated into the project.
```

Armory will now run on:
```http://8000.workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io```

 
3. Final step, run ```forge init```. 

In case you experienced some kind of issues during this step, checkout the Troubleshooting part of the tutorial.


Thatâ€™s it! You can now use Armory in your project, let's find out how we can actually use it to make an awesome onboarding flow.

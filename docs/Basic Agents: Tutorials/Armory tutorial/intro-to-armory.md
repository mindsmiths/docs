# Introduction to Armory

In this short tutorial, we'll create a simple web-application for an onboarding process using Armory.
Often times people join new events, sign up for an interesting workshop or even join a new company and when that occurs, it'd be really convenient
to onboard them with a good-looking web-app. We'll show you an efficient way to quickly build one, so prepare to be amazed.
After finishing this course, you should be able to create your own Armory web-apps and create different screen templates. 

## What exactly is Armory?
Armory is a Mindsmiths' frontend service that we use for building web-applications. 
One of its biggest perks is that you can easily create different kinds of flows, because with Armory you can quickly build many screens.
 
## Prerequisites
You just need an environment where you have forge set up, everything else will be covered with this tutorial.
Also, you can use an existing Nola Brzina project and add new rules in functions there, or if you prefer to have a fresh start, you can 
easily add these new files to your project. 

## Onboarding
OK, now you know what's cooking, are you ready to start with your very next tutorial? This time, we came up with a simple onboarding process flow through a web application.
You will learn how to quickly build different kind of screens, how templates are used, how is it combined with agents and signals and much more.

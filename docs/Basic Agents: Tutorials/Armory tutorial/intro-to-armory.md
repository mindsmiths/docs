# Introduction to Armory

In this short tutorial, we'll create a simple web-application for an onboarding process using Armory.
Often times people join new events, sign up for an interesting workshop or even join a new company and when that occurs, it'd be really convenient
to onboard them with a good-looking web-app. We'll show you an efficient way to quickly build one, so prepare to be amazed.
After finishing this course, you should be able to create your own Armory web-apps and create different screen templates. 

## What exactly is Armory?
Mindsmiths Armory allows us to dinamically generate web-application screens. It is seamlessly integrated with the Mindsmiths platform, with predefined components and styles - which makes prototyping fast and easy
## Prerequisites
In this tutorial, we'll be creating a new agent - Mindy Smith, she is going to guide you through your screen building journey.

For start, create an empty `Mindy.java` file in `rule_engine/src/main/java/agents` and `Mindy.drl` file in `rule_engine/src/main/resources/rules/mindy`, 
after which you'll add new functions with every new step of the tutorial.
  
## Onboarding
OK, now you know what's cooking, are you ready to start with your very next tutorial? This time, we came up with a simple onboarding process flow through a web application.
You will learn how to quickly build different kind of screens, how templates are used, how is it combined with agents and signals and much more.

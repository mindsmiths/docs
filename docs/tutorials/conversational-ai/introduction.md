In this tutorial, you will create an intelligent and fun conversation
partner using the Mindsmiths Platform in just a couple simple steps.

You will learn how to:
- Create a new AI agent
- Add basic business logic to your agent
- Connect to a chat interface
- Integrate with a state-of-the-art language model
- Implement advanced business logic by human-like features (memory, personalities, etc.)

Our agent is called Nola, but you can call yours whatever you like.

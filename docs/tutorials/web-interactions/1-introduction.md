In this short tutorial, you'll create a simple web-application for creating workout plans using Armory. 
Even if you've never made your own web-app before, don't worry. We'll take you through everything step by step, and after the tutorial you'll be able to confidently create intuitive and customized web-apps. 


## Motivation

Often times people join an event, sign up for an interesting workshop or even apply for a position at a new company via some sort of form following a standardized process.
In these situations, you want to both do a good job onboarding the person, and provide a user experience that will make users feel comfortable.

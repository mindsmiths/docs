# Getting started

:::note
This tutorial series **doesn't expect any prior knowledge** about AI-first systems or Mindsmiths Platform. 
There is **no setup required** to start this tutorial series.
:::

Welcome to the Mindsmiths Platform tutorial series!
Here you will learn how to **build AI-first systems using the Mindsmiths Platform**.

## Overview

The series is divided into 3 parts:
1. [Building a conversational AI assistant](conversational-ai/introduction)
will give you a basic understanding of how to use the Mindsmiths Platform by integrating
state-of-the-art language models and supercharging them.
2. [Scaling a healthcare system with autolearning](autolearning/introduction)
will teach you how to use the Mindsmiths Platform to build a system that can learn by itself
from data it dynamically gathers.
3. [Creating an AI-first, web-based onboarding](web-interactions/introduction)
will empower you to use Mindsmiths tools to easily create meaningful, web-based experiences.

:::tip
Even if you're a seasoned developer, we suggest you start from the beginning to 
get a feel for the Mindsmiths Platform. For a more detailed overview of the platform,
check out the [documentation](/platform/getting-started.md).

## Before we begin
**No setup is required** to start this tutorial series.
The Mindsmiths Platform is fully cloud-based.
To access it, you just need a Mindsmiths IDE â€” a VSCode-like web IDE.

If you don't already have one, go to the 
[Mindsmiths Discord](https://discord.gg/mindsmiths) and just ask for one in *#dev* channel.
It will take just a few minutes for us to get your IDE up and running.

Your IDE should look something like this:

If your IDE doesn't look like this, check out our [FAQ](/docs/platform/reference/faq) for common problems,
or geet in touch through [Discord](https://discord.gg/mindsmiths).

To check that everything is set up correctly, open the terminal in the IDE and type `forge run`.
Now just watch the Platform come to life! You should soon see the **heartbeat of your personal helper - Agent Smith**.

```console
14:41:53 rule-engine | [2022-02-14 14:41:53.406] [INFO]: Smith's heartbeat - num agents: 1
14:41:55 rule-engine | [2022-02-14 14:41:55.409] [INFO]: Smith's heartbeat - num agents: 1
```


:::tip
You don't have to worry about what _heartbeat_ means straight away. For now this simply means you are fully set and ready to start developing.
You can stop the platform by pressing **CTRL+C** in the Terminal.

# Intro

Welcome to the BMI Checker Tutorial!

Here you will learn how to use some more advanced features of the platform. Together we'll develop a more complex system, working with multiple types of agents. 

This combination brings human-to-machine communication to another level, and makes digital agents emotionally intelligent. 

In this demo, we’re implementing a health assistant for identifying potential obesity issues in children and adolescents. We want to create a system 
that can help parents take care of their child’s health by keeping their weight in check.
This is a real-life problem that is fairly well-defined, but not as straight-forward in its calculation as it is for adults.
That's why at first it requires expert knowledge from a doctor who will evaluate the BMI queries themselves, before the machine can take over.

By enabling effective communication and collaboration between agents, we can build a system that is capable of handling complex problems in a more efficient and effective way than a single agent could on its own.

This is a slightly more complex use case compared to the first tutorial, but we’ll get through it together step by step,
taking care to implement all three core agent characteristics. 

Let's have a look!

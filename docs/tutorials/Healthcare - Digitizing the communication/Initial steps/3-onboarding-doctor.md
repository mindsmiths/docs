# Welcome doctor

So, let's go through the code we prepared for you. We start from onboarding the users in our system. 

As mentioned, in this demo we're onboarding two types of users: 
- patients 
- doctors

Since we will have two types of users, each with their own agent, you will have to register two Telegram bots.
As we suppose that you have already created one Telegram bot using the instructions from the previous tutorial, 
you will need to find a second phone number to register the second bot. So for the purposes of this tutorial,
we encourage you to ask your wife or husband, your son or daughter, your mother, father, neighbour, friend or enemy for 
their phone while you are completing this tutorial.

You can find the welcome rules in the corresponding `.drl` files for the two agent types (`Patient.drl` and `Doctor.drl`). 
Let's go through doctor `.drl` and `java` files first.

```java title="rules/doctor/Doctor.drl"
package rules.doctor;

import com.mindsmiths.ruleEngine.model.Initialize
import com.mindsmiths.telegramAdapter.events.TelegramReceivedMessage

import agents.Doctor

rule "Welcome doctor"
    when
        signal: Initialize() from entry-point "signals"
        doctor: Doctor()
    then
        doctor.sendMessage("Welcome, doctor!");
        delete(signal);
end
```

As we said, this is because we made a simplification in the design of the demo:
the first person to register will always be the doctor, and every next person will by default be registered as a patient.

Since we always have a single doctor, we also hardcoded the agentâ€™s id to make the inter-agent communication easier. 
The rest of the Doctor.java file should already look familiar to you from the previous tutorial, as it's only used for communication over Telegram:

```java title="java/agents/Doctor.java"
package agents;

import java.util.Arrays;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

import com.mindsmiths.ruleEngine.model.Agent;
import com.mindsmiths.telegramAdapter.TelegramAdapterAPI;

@Getter
@Setter
public class Doctor extends Agent {
    public static String ID = "DOCTOR";

    public Doctor() {
        id = ID;
    }

    public void sendMessage(String text) {
        TelegramAdapterAPI.sendMessage(getConnection("telegram"), text);
    }
}
```

If you want to try onboarding the doctor, you can already hit **FORGE RUN** and send your Telegram bot a message.
We'll now focus on the differences in the implementation of the rest of the onboarding steps for the doctor and the patients.

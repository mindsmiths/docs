# Doctor and Patient Agents: Local view

We already mentioned that each agent cares only for the needs of the user it is assigned to, 
instead of being concerned with searching for optimal solutions at system level.

Looking at the principles behind the implementation, there is nothing especially new you will learn from the process of onboarding patients compared to the user communication
you implemented in the Nola Brzina Tutorial.


So instead of guiding you through typing out the code yourself, we want to draw your attention to some principles of developing smart and emotionally intelligent agents.
The key moment is shifting the focus to the users themselves: what would a patient want from their agent in order to feel comfortable and cared for?
As opposed to that, would the doctor need from their agent? Their roles in real life are different, so the logic implemented by the agents necessarily differ as well.

Generally speaking, we argue that there are three key components the users look for and appreciate in this kind of digital relationships:
- _I KNOW YOU_ (personalized approach)
- _I CARE ABOUT YOU_ (proactive care)
- _I HAVE THE EXPERTISE_ (relevant expert knowledge)

We'll demonstrate these characteristics throughout the implementation of the communication between the agents and the users.

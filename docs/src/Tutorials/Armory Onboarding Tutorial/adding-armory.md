# Adding Armory to the project

You can add Armory to your project in a few easy steps:
1. First install Armory by running ```pip install armory~=5.0.0b0``` in the Terminal
2. Next run the ```armory-admin setup``` command to integrate Armory into the project  

This command will prompt you to:
   * Choose the agent handling signals coming from Armory
   * Provide the Armory site URL, which you will use to access Armory later on

In this tutorial, we'll create agent Mindy to handle all Armory signals. In case you choose a different name, make sure to keep it consistent throughout the tutorial.

For Armory site URL you use your environment URL, e.g. 
`http://workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io`, with the `0000000000` being the digits you have in your web IDE link.

This process will look something like this:

```console
root:/app$ armory-admin setup
What agent will handle signals? Mindy
URL of your IDE (leave empty if running locally): 
http://workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io
Service successfully integrated into the project.
```

Armory will now run on:
```http://8000.workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io```

 
3. Finally, run ```forge init```. 

In case you experienced some kind of issues during this step, checkout the Troubleshooting part of the tutorial.

Otherwise, thatâ€™s it! You can now use Armory in your project, so let's start with creating your first awesome onboarding flow.

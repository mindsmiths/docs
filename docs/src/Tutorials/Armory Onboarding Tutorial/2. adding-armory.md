# Adding Armory to your project

Now let's add Armory to your project!
1. First, install Armory by running ```pip install armory~=4.0.0a0``` in the Terminal
2. Next, run the ``` armory-admin setup``` command, to integrate Armory into the project. 
After running the command, you should:
* Choose the agent handling signals coming from Armory - as we mentioned earlier, we'll create an agent Felix to handle all Armory signals. You can use any name you like, but in case you choose a different name, make sure to keep it consistent throughout the tutorial.
* Provide the Armory site URL, which you'll use to access Armory later on - for Armory site URL you use your environment URL, e.g. http://workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io, with the 0000000000 being the digits you have in your web IDE link. The URL will automatically be saved in the env file, where you can find it at any moment.

This process will look something like this:

```console
root:/app$ armory-admin setup
What agent will handle signals? Felix
URL of your IDE (leave empty if running locally): 
http://8000.workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io
Service successfully integrated into the project.
```

Armory will now run on:
```http://8000.workspace-ms-0000000000.sandbox.mindsmiths.io```

3. Check that your ```Runner.java``` reads configuration from ```signals.yaml```. It should look something like this:

```java title="src/main/java/Runner.java"
public class Runner extends RuleEngineService {
    @Override
    public void initialize() {
        configureSignals(getClass().getResourceAsStream("config/signals.yaml"));
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

If not, add ```configureSignals(getClass().getResourceAsStream("config/signals.yaml"));``` in ```initialize()```.

 
4. Finally, run forge run! Run ```forge init``` and that's it! 
You can now use Armory in your project, let's find out how we can actually use it to make an awesome onboarding flow.

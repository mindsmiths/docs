# Environment setup

The Mindsmiths Platform is fully cloud-based, and you can access it via a link to a Visual Studio Code web IDE.
You can request access to an instance of the platform [here](mailto:info@mindsmiths.com).

To check that everything is set up correctly, just click **FORGE RUN** in the upper right corner.
Now just watch the Platform come to life! You should soon see the heartbeat of your personal helper - Agent Smith.

```console
14:41:53 rule-engine | [2022-02-14 14:41:53.406] [INFO]: Smith's heartbeat - num agents: 1
14:41:55 rule-engine | [2022-02-14 14:41:55.409] [INFO]: Smith's heartbeat - num agents: 1
```


:::tip
You don't have to worry about what _heartbeat_ means straight away. For now this simply means you are fully set and ready to start with development.
You can stop the run by pressing **CTRL+C** in the Terminal. Now letâ€™s get rolling!

# Service communication
## ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

Just like agents, our services also communicate through signals. This allows for a highly decoupled and performant
architecture and enables service-to-service as well as service-to-agent signal exchange.

Basic structure of every signal consists of 4 key fields:
```json
{
  "id": "<unique-signal-id>",
  "timestamp": "<when-the-signal-was-sent>",
  "signalType": "<signal-type",  // eg. "MESSAGE", "EVENT", "REPLY"
  "from": "<who-is-sending-the-signal>",
  ...  // other fields depending on the signal type
}
```
Most of the mentioned fields are automatically generated and added for you. All signals, no matter the type, are meant to be subclassed. This allows adding additional fields at any time.

In total, there are 5 different signal types:
1. Message
2. Event
3. Reply
4. ErrorReply
5. DataChangeEvent

These signals are serialized to JSON before being sent to the message broker, and deserialized on the receiving side, automatically by the platform.

Every service defines its own input topic on which it listens for messages. You can think of topics like queues with unique addresses.
To make communicating with them easier, most services define their own clients, which automatically build messages in the correct format and send them to the right topic (e.g. TelegramAdapterAPI).
On the other hand, agents share one input topic.

## Messages
Messages are signals that are used whenever there's a specific agent or a concrete service that you want to send message to. 

Examples of messages:
- agent sends an offer to user
- user sends a new metric input to agent 
- agent sends a reminder to user
- ...

It's important that every `Message` defines its `messageType`, which defaults to the name of the message class (e.g. Offer).
Besides the type field, there's another mandatory element - `to`, which specifies the recipient's ID. If an answer to current `Message` is expected,
then you should specify the `returnAddress` field - that's the address to which the reply should be sent. 

## Events
Apart from direct messages (going to a specific service/agent), there are also `Event` signals. 
We use them when an agent or a service wants to notify its surroundings that something happened.
Events are used as broadcast signals, which means that there is no `to` field to specify.  
Instead, each `Event` type has its own "event" topic, which anyone can listen to. 
This means other agents and services can subscribe to a specific event. 

Some examples of events:
- a new user is registered
- some threshold is reached
- an ML model was retrained
- ...

Events are great for decoupling services, which allows for more flexibility and extensibility.

## Replies
`Reply` signals are special `Message` signals that represent responses to previously sent requests (messages).
In addition to all the fields a normal message would have, replies also have `replyTo` that should contain the message to which this response relates to.
This field defaults to the `Message` that's currently being processed.

An example would be:
1. We send a request to the GCalendar adapter asking it which events the user has tomorrow
2. GCalendar adapter queries the user's calendar
3. GCalendar adapter sends the reply with the result back to the sender:
   1. If the sender was a service, a callback function is called with the result 
   2. If the sender was an agent, the reply is inserted to the signals entry point

On the side note, if no address is specified when sending a `Reply`, then the `replyTo` field defaults to `replyTo.returnAddress`, which is also an optional field.
Therefore, it's also possible that `replyTo.returnAddress` is undefined, after which the address is generated from `replyTo.from`.

## ErrorReply
`ErrorReply` is a subtype of `Reply` signal that signalizes that the received `Message` couldn't be properly processed.

Besides all the fields that a regular `Reply`, this signal has an addition of a few others - `code`, `description` (both mandatory to fill)
and `help`. 

## Data changes (event-carried state transfer)
`DataChangeEvent` is a special type of event that is sent when an "emmitable" data model is either created, updated or deleted.
Other agents/services can subscribe to the changes of a specific data object.


## Emitting and listening to events
To emit an event to other services, first you need to define the event model. However, you need to be careful to define
it somewhere in the service `api/` directory, because other services only have access to that package.

For example:
```python
class UserRegistered(Event):
    userId: str
    registeredAt: datetime
    user: User
```

To emit the event, just do:
```python
UserRegistered(userId=userId, registeredAt=get_utc_datetime(), user=user).emit()
```

To listen to events from other services, simply add a new function and decorate it with `@on_event(<EventCls>)`, for example:
```python
from another_service.api import UserRegistered

class NewService(BaseService):
    ...

    @on_event(UserRegistered)
    def on_user_registered(self, user_registered: UserRegistered) -> None:
        ...
```

### Addresses
Every service and agent has an address on which it receives signals. Service's default address is its name, while all agents share one address (`agents`).
No mather what the type of signal is being sent or emitted, the address stays the same.
